# Tetris - 'AI'

## Tetris Game
Simple python Tetris with both human and 'AI' player (AI can be toggled). 
The gaming mechanism is from https://gist.github.com/silvasur/565419 with a heavy graphic redesign.

## 'AI'
'AI' is in quotes because it is not true artificial intelligence - none of the fancy q-learning, genetic algorithms,
 neural-network etc. were implemented. This was partly due to lack of computational power and time available to train 
 the model and the curiosity of comparing the performance of 'hard-coded' algorithms and various machine learning
  produced algorithms.

'AI' logic and implementation are inspired by https://levelup.gitconnected.com/tetris-ai-in-python-bd194d6326ae.
